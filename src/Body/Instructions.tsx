                    <li><b>Fork Chosen Project and Clone</b></li>

                    <br/>
                    Usually best done with a keyboard, but sometimes a hammer is the only thing to get the job done.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li><b>IMPORTANT! Create a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">Pull Request</a> back to Upstream GitHub Repository</b>

                    This is how you get your points, so donâ€™t forget it!
                    <br/>
                    Also, there can be a 5 minute delay for your scores to be updated after a PR is submitted.</li>
