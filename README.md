# BBash

Tooling to enable a Bug Bash

## Development

### Setup

To get started with this project you will need:

- Make (on macOS, you could use [brew](https://brew.sh) via `brew install make` should suffice).
- Golang (see: [Download and Install](https://go.dev/doc/install). This project started using Go 1.16.2, but likely anything above 1.14 is fine). Using 1.17.8 now.
- Docker (see: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Npm (see: [Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))

  On Ubuntu, you could use these commands to get the latest stable node version setup:

      sudo apt install npm
      sudo npm cache clean -f
      sudo npm install -g n
      sudo n stable

  You may have to restart the terminal after running the above steps to see the latest node version. 
- Yarn: `sudo npm install --global yarn` (see: [Installation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))
- Air

    To install air:

    - https://github.com/cosmtrek/air

    You can run:

    - `go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@v1.29.0`

    The `air` binary will be located in your `~/go/bin` folder, which may need to added to your commands and/or path.
    The [AIRCMD](Makefile#L6) setting in the Makefile may need to be adjusted if a different location is used. 

### Running/Developing

Thanks to Air, there is some amount of "live-reload". To run the project, you can run `air -c .air.toml` in the project root. 
Once it is built, you should be able to access the site at http://localhost:7777/.
The app pages live at: http://localhost:7777/index.html

Any code changes to golang files will cause a rebuild and restart, and will be accessible via the browser with a refresh!

#### Local Development Setup
For local development, a good first step is to copy the example `.env.example` file to `.env` and launch a local db
and `air` like so:
```shell
cp .env.example .env
make run-air
```

Note that Datadog polling, which is used to calculate scores, is disabled by default in `.env.example` to decrease noise during local development.
To re-enable [remove this line](.env.example#L18).

#### Server Debugging
For some fun interactive debugging of the golang app with [server.go](./server.go), you could spin up the local docker db image, and manually run
the server in debug mode. See the [Makefile](./Makefile) for the latest and greatest commands to cherry-pick.
```shell
$ docker run --name bug_bash_postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=bug_bash -e POSTGRES_DB=db -d postgres
b6ac8769bab3b19b3e5818e726272bcee6957863b9a7af4261a0ae29ec5bc68e...
```
Then run [server.go](./server.go) in debug mode in your favorite IDE, and enjoy break points activating when you connect to 
endpoints. Wee!

#### Frontend Development
For frontend work (with a previously manually launched database - see `docker run ...` above), this command is helpful for development:
```shell
make run-air-alone
```

## Architecture

"Two apps in one" - This project contains two apps:
  1. A [golang](https://go.dev) application that provides REST endpoints for the UI and admin tasks, and polls [Lift](https://lift.sonatype.com/getting-started) for scoring events.
  2. A [react](https://reactjs.org) application that provides a UI, and calls the REST endpoints served by the golang app. 

#### Go

  The go application specific files include:

   * [server.go](./server.go)
   * [internal](./internal/)
   * [go.mod](./go.mod)
    
  The go application communicates with the postgres database. The go application also 
  periodically polls the Lift logs for scoring events.

#### React

  The react application files include:

  * [src](./src/)
  * [public](./public/)
  * [package.json](./package.json)
  * [yarn.lock](./yarn.lock)
   

## Deployment

#### App environment configuration

Configuration of `bbash` is handled via a `.env` file in the repo (this is ignored by git by default, so you don't check in secrets):

A `.example.env` has been provided that looks similar to the following:

```
PG_USERNAME=postgres
PG_PASSWORD=bug_bash
PG_PORT=5432
PG_DB_NAME=db
PG_HOST=localhost
SSL_MODE=disable
```

### Deploy Application to AWS

Thankfully, we've made this as simple as possible, we think? It'll get simpler with time, I'm sure :)

You will need:

- `terraform`
- `aws cli`
- `aws-vault`
- `docker`

#### Terraform

- `aws-vault exec <your_profile> terraform init`
- `aws-vault exec <your_profile> terraform apply`

This should create all the nice lil AWS resources to manage this application, using ECS and ECR!

#### Docker

To create the docker image:

- `make docker`

#### Deployment

Some pre-requisite/one-time setup steps:

  * setup aws cli configuration to verify working credentials. see: [AWS CLI on mac](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html)

  * install `aws-vault`
        
        $ brew install --cask aws-vault

  * add aws-vault profile ("<your_profile>" in steps below) for use in pushing images

        $ aws-vault add my-bbash-profile

  * (One-time) initialize terraform

        $ aws-vault exec <your_profile> terraform init

  * View terraform actions to be taken:

        $ aws-vault exec <your_profile> terraform plan


An executable bash script (`docker.sh`?) similar to the following will make pushing images easier:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
aws-vault exec <your_profile> aws ecr get-login-password --region <aws_region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
docker tag bug-bash:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com/bug-bash-app:latest
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com/bug-bash-app:latest
aws-vault exec <your_profile> -- aws ecs update-service --cluster bug-bash-cluster --service bug-bash-service --force-new-deployment
```

Replace the stuff in the `<>` with your values (and remove the `<>` characters if that isn't immediately apparent), `chmod +x docker.sh`, and `./docker.sh`

After you have done this, you SHOULD have a running service, somewhere in AWS :) - maybe someplace like this? :
[sandbox-dev](https://bug-bash.innovations-sandbox.sonatype.dev) or [sandbox-dev/index.html](https://bug-bash.innovations-sandbox.sonatype.dev/index.html) 

With all the above configured, here's the deployment command in full:

    make && make docker && ./docker.sh

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `bbash` support in regard to this project
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using `bbash`, we are glad to have you here!
